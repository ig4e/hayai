- `Other` - Technical changes/updates

## [Unreleased]

### Additions
- Add **Reduce motion** toggle in Settings → Appearance → Motion. Disables Conductor controller transitions, Compose animations (skeleton shimmers etc.), Coil image crossfade, and per-Activity open/close transitions in one switch — aimed at low-end devices, motion-sensitive users, and battery saver. Single source of truth (`ReducedMotion.isEnabled()` / `LocalReducedMotion`); call sites stay clean.
- Add E-Hentai / ExHentai **category badges** to the browse list and grid (Doujinshi / Manga / Image Set / Artist CG / Cosplay / Game CG / Western / Non-H / Asian Porn / Misc), color-coded.
- Add LNReader `parsePage` support for novel sources that paginate chapter listings (rewayatclub, lnmtl, sunovels, lightnoveltranslation, …) — full chapter list is now fetched, not just page 1.
- Add source navigation from recommendation card headers (tap a source header to open `BrowseRecommendsScreen` for that source)
- Add `MetadataMangasPage` and Compose-based genre tags on manga details
- Migrate manga details grid and color filters to Compose
- Add migration parallelism with concurrency limits for faster batch source migration (1–10 concurrent, configurable in Advanced settings)
- Add NovelUpdates dedicated parser and refactor of the NovelUpdates source
- Add novel plugin cache and improved plugin manager integration
- Browse-page filter (Settings → Sources from the browse menu) now lists novel sources alongside manga, grouped under their language. Novel icons are loaded from the plugin's `iconUrl` via Coil with a `ic_book_24dp` fallback.

### Changes
- Novel browse pagination now follows the LNReader contract: keep loading until the plugin returns an empty list (was hard-stopped at page 1).
- Tolerate plugins that emit `genres` joined with `","` instead of `", "` — they used to render as one big chip; now they split correctly. Duplicates and inconsistent casing are deduped at the novel parser too.
- Novel summary is now HTML-stripped (preserving paragraph breaks) for plugins that return raw markup per the LNReader contract.
- Improve page previews: bigger thumbnails, skeleton loading, and infinite scroll
- Reduce top spacing for app bar title
- Recommendation cards now use a transparent container color to better blend with the surface
- Revert filter sheet to the stable View-based implementation while the Compose version is hardened (replaces the temporary 1.15.0 Compose filter sheet)
- Fall back to the system installer on MIUI devices when in-app install is unreliable
- Per-language source toggle in the browse-page filter renamed to **Select all** (was "All sources") so it reads as a UI control rather than a phantom iconless source.
- App icons & branding assets refreshed for all density buckets and flavors (main, debug, nightly).

### Fixes
- **Fix novel sources crashing with `RejectedExecutionException: The task was rejected` on every browse / chapter call** — regression from the per-source dispatcher work. `NovelJsRuntime.close()` was shutting down the executor *and* `doInitialize()` called `close()` first thing for defensive cleanup, so the per-source executor died the moment init finished and every subsequent `withContext(jsDispatcher)` was rejected. Split `close()` (full teardown — only call from `destroy()`) from `closeQuickJsOnly()` (preserve executor — used by init's pre/retry cleanup).
- **Fix all LNReader plugins failing to initialize with `Module not found: node:stream`** after we tried to upgrade to cheerio 1.x. cheerio 1.x's node entry imports node-builtin modules (`node:stream`, `node:string_decoder`, `node:events`, `node:buffer`) that QuickJS has no resolver for. Bundle cheerio with `platform: 'browser'` so esbuild picks the browser entry, alias the few remaining node-builtin imports to an empty stub so esbuild produces a self-contained bundle. Pinned cheerio to `1.0.0` (was `^1.0.0-rc.12`) to match what the LNReader plugin corpus is tested against.
- **Fix sources disappearing from the browse list / extensions filter showing nothing.** Two `collectLatest` blocks in `SourceManager` were both doing read-modify-write on the same `MutableStateFlow` source map; their writes could clobber each other on cold start, extension install, or novel-plugin refresh, leaving the list with only LocalSource + EH + MergedSource + novels. Collapsed into a single `combine()` so there's exactly one writer.
- **Fix novel sources not working** ([#12](https://github.com/ig4e/hayai/issues/12)). Root causes ranged across the JS bridge, the novel runtime, and LNReader-plugin compatibility:
  - `__bridge.fetch / fetchText / fetchFile / sleep` are now suspend on the Kotlin side and bound via QuickJS `asyncFunction` so OkHttp work runs on `Dispatchers.IO` instead of stalling the JS worker thread.
  - Each `NovelJsRuntime` now gets its own single-thread executor (8 MB stack) shut down on `close()` instead of sharing one global dispatcher — uninstalled plugins no longer leak threads, and one slow source no longer blocks another.
  - `NovelSource.ensureRuntime()` and `destroy()` are guarded by a `Mutex` so racing coroutines (browse + reader prefetch, etc.) can't double-initialize and leak QuickJS contexts or close a runtime mid-init.
  - `NovelPluginManager` now uses a `ConcurrentHashMap` + `installMutex` for all installed-source mutations, `SupervisorJob` so one failing plugin can't kill the manager scope, and caches the system UA at construction (calling `WebSettings.getDefaultUserAgent` from IO threads threw on some Android versions).
  - New `timers_shim.js` overrides the polyfill `setTimeout` / `setInterval` with async-aware versions backed by `__bridge.sleep` — the polyfill's sync impl silently fired callbacks immediately under the new async bridge, breaking every plugin that throttles via `await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, ms))`.
  - `fetchProto` is now implemented entirely in JS using the bundled protobufjs (mirrors `lnreader-plugins/src/lib/fetch.ts:fetchProto`, gRPC-Web framing included). The Kotlin stub that returned `{}` is gone, so WuxiaWorld and other proto-based plugins actually work now.
  - Default headers synced with LNReader's `makeInit` (drop `Cache-Control: max-age=0`, add `Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate`); only auto-managed encoding values are stripped on the Kotlin side so plugins can still pass `identity` etc. through.
  - `LocalStorage` / `SessionStorage` shims now match LNReader's per-instance dict semantics instead of returning a single SharedPreferences blob, which silently broke any plugin that tried to read individual keys off the result.
  - Added `@/types/constants` to `require_impl.js` so plugins like novelfire that import path-aliased modules from the LNReader build resolve at runtime (tsc preserves these aliases verbatim in compiled output).
  - Bundled 7 additional runtime libraries (buffer, fetch-globals, text-encoding, htmlparser2, crypto-js, pako, protobufjs) needed by the full LNReader plugin surface (~1.3 MB total).
- Fix `MergedSource` and other entries in `BlacklistedSources.HIDDEN_SOURCES` leaking into global search, the migration target list, and the per-language source toggle. Centralized via new `SourceManager.getVisibleCatalogueSources()` / `getVisibleOnlineSources()` helpers (mirrors TachiyomiSY's `AndroidSourceManager` pattern); call sites switched over.
- Fix the browse-page extension filter screen sometimes rendering permanently blank when opened before the bottom-sheet ever loaded available extensions/plugins. `ExtensionFilterController` now kicks `findAvailableExtensions()` / `refreshAvailablePlugins()` if either flow is empty, and re-renders whenever either emits.
- Fix metadata enrichment, namespace search, and page previews silently not firing for Pururin / Tsumino / MangaDex / HBrowse / 8Muses / LANraragi extensions: the EXH `DELEGATED_SOURCES` table only had NHentai. Restored the other six entries (matches TachiyomiSY); installed extensions now get wrapped with `EnhancedHttpSource`. `exh.source.handleSourceLibrary()` (previously a no-op stub) now recomputes `metadataDelegatedSourceIds`, `nHentaiSourceIds`, `mangaDexSourceIds`, `lanraragiSourceIds`, and `LIBRARY_UPDATE_EXCLUDED_SOURCES` whenever a source delegates.
- Fix `LibraryUpdateJob` running Pururin / NHentai delegated sources through the standard library updater (likely producing 429s or wrong chapter data) — replaced the hardcoded `EH_SOURCE_ID || EXH_SOURCE_ID` check with `LIBRARY_UPDATE_EXCLUDED_SOURCES`, which is now correctly populated.
- Fix the eHentai extension showing as installable in browse and counting toward update-badges. `ExtensionApi` now filters `BlacklistedSources.BLACKLISTED_EXTENSIONS` at the parse step.
- Fix `ExtensionManager.updatedInstalledExtensionsStatuses` pinning an extension to `isObsolete = true` forever once flagged, even after it returned to the available list (inverted condition rewrote the same value back).
- Fix novel chapter downloads silently sticking at `DOWNLOADING` forever and blocking the queue — replaced the brittle `download.source is TextSource && is NovelSource` / `is HttpSource` else-if chain with a typed `when()` that errors on unknown source types.
- Fix `.nomedia` not being created in download chapter directories on devices using SAF — `UniFile.renameTo` invalidates the `DocumentFile` handle on many devices, so the post-rename create silently no-op'd. Now writes `.nomedia` before the rename. CBZ branch correctly skips.
- Guard `DownloadManager.buildPageList` against `TextSource` so callers can't surface a misleading "no pages found" for novel chapters.
- Fix novel sources rendering without their icon in the Migrations tab — the migration `SourceHolder` now falls back to the plugin's `iconUrl` (or a book glyph) when the manga `ExtensionManager` has no app icon, matching the regular browse list. The same fallback was added to the per-manga Migrate target list.
- Fix novel sources rendering oversized in the browse-page filter list — raw `BitmapDrawable`s from Coil filled the icon slot 100% while manga `AdaptiveIconDrawable`s have a built-in ~16.7% safe zone. Novel icons are now wrapped in an `InsetDrawable` with the same fraction so both source types render at consistent visual size.
- Fix `MergedSource` appearing in the per-manga Migrate target source list — `PreMigrationController` now filters out `BlacklistedSources.HIDDEN_SOURCES` for both manga and novel migrations.
- Per-manga Migrate now picks the right catalogue for the entry being migrated: novels see only novel (`TextSource`) sources, manga see only `HttpSource` sources. `MigrationSourceItem`/`MigrationSourceHolder` widened from `HttpSource` to `CatalogueSource`.
- Fix `PreMigrationController.isNovelMigration` deadlocking against `SourceManager.getOrStub()` while novel plugins were still loading. The lookup is now `lifecycleScope`-launched on `Dispatchers.IO` and gates adapter creation on completion, instead of `runBlocking{}` on the UI thread.
- Fix tapping a page-preview thumbnail opening page 1 instead of the tapped page (race between two state observers in `ReaderViewModel`; now the requested page is plumbed through `ChapterLoader` before `viewerChapters` is published).
- Fix recommendation card clicks being silently dropped for external sources (AniList / MyAnimeList / NovelUpdates / etc.); they now route to global search by title across installed sources, matching TachiyomiSY's behavior.
- Fix `NovelUpdatesParser.<clinit>` and `MdUtil.<clinit>` crashes (`PatternSyntaxException` on Android's ICU regex engine: `[^]]` is invalid; escaped to `[^\]]`). The first crash also took down anything that loaded the recommendations screen.
- Fix follow-up `NovelUpdatesParser.<clinit>` crash (`PatternSyntaxException` near index 28) — the bracket-stripping regex still had bare `]` and `}` outside their character classes, which Android's ICU parser rejects. Escaped both closing delimiters so the pattern compiles and recommendations stop crashing on launch.
- Fix QuickJS plugin errors (e.g. `Could not find chapter content`) crashing the whole app — they were rethrown out of a `launch(IO)` with no `CoroutineExceptionHandler`. The novel page loaders now match `HttpPageLoader`'s pattern: set `Page.State.Error` and let the existing reader UI show the retry state.
- Fix novel chapter list missing pages 2+ for plugins that report `totalPages` (`parsePage` is now called and merged before reversal).
- Fix null `transitionName` crash when opening a chapter from the header button
- Fix AutoComplete filter crash, dark mode handling, and live chip updates
- Fix Injekt `TypeReference` crash and null-safety issues across EXH handlers and `SettingsEhScreen`
- Harden EXH recommendation sources and config parsing against crashes
- Harden general crash handling and extension loading
- Handle source popups as separate WebView instances (#608)
- Fix E-Hentai previews and description layout
- Fix namespace tag position/style, page preview, and description state
- Fix preview images, popular pagination, and manga detail UX
- Manga detail and EHentai miscellaneous fixes

### Other
- Speed up CI builds with Gradle caching and parallelism
- Cold-start hardening: WorkManager auto-init disabled in `AndroidManifest`; `App` implements `Configuration.Provider` so workers don't try to instantiate before Koin is started. `MainActivity` flips `splashState.ready` immediately rather than waiting inside a coroutine that didn't run until past the 5 s splash cap. `AppModule.initExpensiveComponents` launches on `Dispatchers.IO` so cold start doesn't block the main thread.
- `SourceManager.toInternalSource` now `error()`s in debug builds when a delegate's 2-param constructor goes missing, instead of silently degrading to the unwrapped source — catches signature drift fast in dev without crashing release users.
- `NovelPluginCache` writes are now atomic (write-tmp + rename) so an OOM kill mid-write can't truncate the cache and force a JS metadata re-extraction (~700 ms per plugin) on the next cold start.
- `NovelSource.pluginCode` is no longer held resident for the source's lifetime — replaced with a `() -> String` provider that reads from the on-disk file when the runtime initializes, freeing tens-to-hundreds of KB per installed plugin.
