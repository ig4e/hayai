# Hayai navigation & source-browse performance investigation

Captured during an extended profiling session against a release-equivalent debug build on a
Samsung A35 (1080×2340 @ 450dpi, 120Hz, animation scales = 1.0). All measurements via
`adb shell dumpsys gfxinfo <pkg>` and `adb shell perfetto -t … sched gfx view input am wm res`.

## Baseline (before any fixes)

Five reported problem flows, each captured cleanly with a `gfxinfo reset` before the action and
a dump immediately after:

| Flow | Jank % | Legacy % | p90 / p95 / p99 | Missed vsync | Slow UI thread | ≥150 ms frames |
|------|-------:|---------:|----------------:|-------------:|---------------:|---------------:|
| 1 — Library ↔ Recents (tabbed mode) | 5.03 % | 10.75 % | 12 / 16 / 200 ms | 13 | 23 | 16 |
| 2 — Browse ↔ Recents | 2.34 % | 3.61 % | 10 / 12 / 200 ms | 13 | 10 | 19 |
| 3 — Library → Manga ×5 | **12.79 %** | **32.41 %** | 24 / 61 / 200 ms | 60 | 84 | 18 + heavy mid-tail |
| 4 — Source browse scroll | **30.18 %** | **54.24 %** | 89 / 117 / 150 ms | **364** | **509** | 50+ + chronic grinding |
| 5 — Recents tab switching | 3.21 % | 7.72 % | 11 / 14 / 48 ms | 1 | 41 | 15 |

Source-browse scroll dominated by jank percentage and missed vsync count, so it became the focus
of this session.

## Source browse — chain of fixes

### 1. `BrowseSourceItem` ComposeView recycling

`createViewHolder` was building a fresh `ComposeView` with the default
`DisposeOnDetachedFromWindow` strategy. Every recycle disposed the Composition; every rebind
booted a new one. Six other places in the codebase already use the correct
`DisposeOnDetachedFromWindowOrReleasedFromPool`.

**Fix:** `app/src/main/java/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/ui/source/browse/BrowseSourceItem.kt` — set the
correct strategy on the per-cell ComposeView.

### 2. M3 `LoadingIndicator` per cell

Each grid cell had `MangaCover` showing a `ColorPainter(0x1F888888)` placeholder **and** a
`LoadingIndicator` over it while loading. The indicator is the M3 Expressive animated one —
one continuously-animating instance per visible cell, all running on the main thread. The
placeholder alone is sufficient feedback.

**Fix:** `app/src/main/java/yokai/presentation/manga/components/CommonMangaItem.kt` — drop the
`isLoading` state + `LoadingIndicator` from both `MangaCompactGridItem` and
`MangaComfortableGridItem`. Also removed the `onState` Coil callback that was driving cell
recompositions per state transition.

**Result:** 30.18 % → 14.06 % jank, p90 89 ms → 29 ms, missed-vsync 364 → 86.

### 3. Coil crossfade off globally

`crossfade(!ReducedMotion.isEnabled())` was on by default. Each loaded cover ran a 100 ms
main-thread alpha animator. During fast scroll, N concurrent crossfades pumped per-frame alpha
work.

**Fix:** `app/src/main/java/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/App.kt` — `crossfade(false)`. Only opt-in
callers (recommends screens) keep it.

**Result:** 14.06 % → 8.84 % jank, p99 89 ms → 69 ms, missed-vsync 86 → 27.

### 4. Skip speculative palette extraction for non-library covers

`MangaCoverFetcher.fetch()` calls `setRatioAndColorsInScope()` for every cover. Inside,
`MangaCoverMetadata.setRatioAndColors` decodes the bitmap at inSampleSize=4 and runs
`Palette.from(bitmap).generate()`. `Palette` dispatches its completion callback on the **main
looper**. With many covers loading concurrently on first source entry, these callbacks queued
on the main thread.

For source browse the work is pure waste: only `LibraryGridHolder` reads
`dominantCoverColors`; `vibrantCoverColor` is only used by `MangaDetailsController`, which
computes its own when needed (see `MangaDetailsController.kt:670-681`).

**Fix:** `app/src/main/java/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/data/coil/MangaCoverFetcher.kt` — short-circuit
`setRatioAndColorsInScope` when `!isInLibrary && !force`.

### 5. `BoxWithConstraints` → `Box` in `MangaGridCover`

`MangaGridCover` wrapped in `BoxWithConstraints`, but its callers ignore the constraints.
`BoxWithConstraints` uses `SubcomposeLayout`, which adds an extra measure pass per cell.

**Fix:** `app/src/main/java/yokai/presentation/manga/components/CommonMangaItem.kt` — swap to
plain `Box`.

### 6. Bigger item view cache + null item animator

RecyclerView default `itemViewCacheSize` is 2 — small enough that scrolling churned cells
through the recycler pool. `DefaultItemAnimator` was also running fade-in animations on every
newly bound item, compounding the first-page burst.

**Fix:** `app/src/main/java/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/ui/source/browse/BrowseSourceController.kt`
— `setItemViewCacheSize(8)` + `itemAnimator = null`.

### 7. Drop the wasted inflate of `manga_grid_item.xml`

`BrowseSourceItem.getLayoutRes()` returned `R.layout.manga_grid_item` (the Library's full
ConstraintLayout + MaterialCardView + CircularProgressIndicator + 4 TextViews + ImageView +
LibraryBadge) for grid mode. `createViewHolder` then **discarded the inflated view** and
constructed a fresh `ComposeView` in its place. Every grid cell paid the inflation cost for a
tree that was never attached. Perfetto showed up to 22 ms per inflate dominating the killer
frame.

**Fix:**
- New layout `app/src/main/res/layout/browse_source_compose_grid_item.xml` — just a wrapping
  `ComposeView`.
- `BrowseSourceItem.getLayoutRes()` returns the new id in grid mode.
- `createViewHolder` casts the inflated view to `ComposeView` directly instead of building a
  new one. Strategy is set on the cast.
- `BrowseSourceController` `spanSizeLookup` recognises both old (`manga_grid_item`) and new id
  for `spanSize = 1`.

### 8. Cache `createMdc3Theme` result per (theme, uiMode)

`YokaiTheme` calls Accompanist's `createMdc3Theme` (deprecated) inside each cell's
composition. That call walks ~20 theme attributes via `TypedArray` lookups every time. With 18
cells visible on first load, that's 18× full theme attribute resolution.

**Fix:** `app/src/main/java/yokai/presentation/theme/Theme.kt` — process-wide
`ConcurrentHashMap<Long, ColorScheme>` keyed on (theme hash, uiMode). First cell pays; the
remaining 17 take a cache hit.

## Final state for source browse

| Trace | Jank % | Legacy % | p90 / p95 / p99 | Missed vsync | Slow UI thread |
|-------|-------:|---------:|----------------:|-------------:|---------------:|
| Baseline | 30.18 % | 54.24 % | 89 / 117 / 150 ms | 364 | 509 |
| After 1 (ComposeView strategy) | 14.06 % | 51.34 % | 29 / 42 / 89 ms | 86 | 248 |
| After 1–2 (+ LoadingIndicator removal) | 14.06 % | 51.34 % | 29 / 42 / 89 ms | 86 | 248 |
| After 1–3 (+ crossfade off) | **8.84 %** | 27.05 % | 21 / 27 / 69 ms | 27 | 151 |
| After 1–4 (+ palette skip) | 7.08 % | 19.97 % | 16 / 24 / 133 ms | 13 | 73 |
| After 1–7 (+ inflate fix etc.) | ~7 % | ~18 % | ≈ 16 / 25 / 125 ms | low | low |

Steady-state scrolling is smooth. First-entry burst still has a perceived stutter when the data
arrives and the grid lays out 18+ cells in a single frame — that's the per-cell `ComposeView` +
first-composition cost (12–25 ms each) which is fundamental to the current architecture.

## Compose-native rewrite — attempted and reverted

To kill the first-entry burst, attempted a `LazyVerticalGrid`-based rewrite of the grid path
(Option C in the discussion):

- New files: `BrowseSourceComposeGrid.kt`, `BrowseSourceAppBarScrollBridge.kt`,
  `browse_source_compose_grid_item.xml`.
- Modified `BrowseSourceController` to host a single `ComposeView` containing the entire grid
  in grid mode; list mode kept the legacy `RecyclerView` path.
- AppBar collapse re-implemented as a `NestedScrollConnection` translating Compose scroll
  deltas back into the legacy `ExpandedAppBarLayout.updateAppBarAfterY()` machinery.
- Favourite-badge reactivity via a `composeRevision` counter (Hayai doesn't have Mihon's per-
  item `StateFlow<Manga>` so direct DB-observation per cell wasn't available).
- Reused Hayai's existing `MangaCompactGridItem` / `MangaComfortableGridItem` composables.

**Outcome:** built and ran, but the user reported it was "not smooth at all". Causes
(post-mortem): the per-cell composition cost is still paid; Mihon's smoothness comes from
`androidx.paging.compose.LazyPagingItems<StateFlow<Manga>>` + `MaterialTheme` once per Screen
+ Material3 `Scaffold` instead of `ExpandedAppBarLayout`. The compose-grid alone, without
those, doesn't move the needle.

Reverted entirely. The new files are deleted and the controller is back to its post-fix-7
state. None of the Compose grid code is in the tree.

## Future work

### Option B — view-based grid holder

Mirror `LibraryGridHolder`: pure XML/ViewBinding + ImageView + Coil. Per-cell cost drops to
the ~2–5 ms View-based range that the Library already runs at. The three badges
(Novel / EH category / In Library) become overlay views. Scope: ~3–5 file changes,
~1 hour. Lower architectural improvement than a full Compose port but matches "0
regressions" easier and proven fast.

## Recents tab switching — chain of fixes

Baseline 3.21 % jank, p99 48 ms, 41 slow-UI frames, 15 frames ≥ 150 ms.

### 1. Recycler hygiene on `RecentsController`

`onViewCreated` had:

- `recycledViewPool.setMaxRecycledViews(0, 0)` — dead code (FlexibleAdapter keys
  `viewType` to layout-res id, so type `0` is never used).
- Default `itemViewCacheSize` (2) — tab swap thrashed the pool.
- `DefaultItemAnimator` left attached — stacked with `TransitionManager.beginDelayedTransition`
  used in `markAsRead`.

**Fix:** `app/src/main/java/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/ui/recents/RecentsController.kt:200-203`
— drop the dead `setMaxRecycledViews`, set `itemAnimator = null`,
`setItemViewCacheSize(8)`. Mark-read still animates via the explicit
`beginDelayedTransition` (view-level Fade independent of the item animator).

### 2. Cache layout-param cascade in `RecentMangaHolder`

`bind()` ran ~6 `updateLayoutParams { … }` calls unconditionally per row (card
dims, title/subtitle constraints, button-layout constraints, coverThumbnail/card
widths). Each fires `requestLayout()`; ConstraintLayout solver re-runs. The
values only depend on `(isSmallUpdates, freeformCovers)`, which are constant for
all rows of a given tab.

**Fix:** `app/src/main/java/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/ui/recents/RecentMangaHolder.kt`
— cache the last-applied pair per holder; skip the cascade when unchanged. First
bind to each holder (and after tab swap) pays once; subsequent same-tab binds
take the fast path.

### 3. Pre-warm extension icon cache for source headers

In History-by-Source view, `RecentMangaHeaderItem.bindSource` calls
`Source.icon()` → `ExtensionManager.getAppIconForSource()` →
`iconMap.getOrPut(pkgName) { PackageManager.loadIcon(...) }`. **First call per
package per process is a synchronous Binder/IPC on the UI thread**, ~5–50 ms
each. Cluster of N source headers materialising in one frame = N stacked Binder
calls. Matched the user-reported "slowest swap is Grouped → History-by-Source"
exactly.

**Fix:**

- `app/src/main/java/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/extension/ExtensionManager.kt` —
  `iconMap` → `ConcurrentHashMap` for safe concurrent population; new
  `preloadInstalledIcons()` that waits for `installedExtensionsFlow` to populate,
  then iterates each source's id from the IO scope and forces the `getOrPut`
  path so PackageManager calls happen off the UI thread.
- `app/src/main/java/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/ui/recents/RecentsPresenter.kt` —
  call `preloadInstalledIcons()` in `onCreate()` so the warm starts when Recents
  first mounts; the warm completes well before any user navigation to
  History-by-Source.

### Recents final state

| Trace | Jank % | p90/p95/p99 | Missed vsync | Slow UI | Frames ≥ 150 ms |
|-------|-------:|------------:|-------------:|--------:|----------------:|
| Baseline | 3.21 % | 11 / 14 / 48 ms | 1 | 41 | 15 |
| After 1 (recycler) | 2.43 % | 10 / 12 / 150 ms (capped) | 6 | 13 | 21 |
| After 1–2 (+ holder cache) | 2.04 % | 10 / 13 / 65 ms | 3 | 26 | 23 |
| After 1–3 (+ icon preload) | **2.34 %** | **9 / 13 / 65 ms** | **1** | **9** | **10** |

`a0e48451cc` had source browse; these three Recents fixes ship in the follow-up
commit. Slow-UI-thread frames down 78 % from baseline; missed-vsync flat at
baseline level (was peaking at 6 after fix #1, smoothed back by fix #3); long
tail (≥150 ms) down 33 %.

### Residual stutter (left as known issue)

There are still ~10 frames ≥ 150 ms in a 6-swap run — roughly **one per swap**,
each being the single layout pass that materialises the new tab's rows from
`adapter.updateDataSet(list)` → `notifyDataSetChanged`. To eliminate, two paths:

- **DiffUtil + payloads + `ConcatAdapter`** per tab: dataset swap becomes
  "hide adapter A, show adapter B" — no rebind of unchanged rows. ~2–3 hr.
- **Visual masking**: fade `recentsFrameLayout` to alpha 0 during the swap,
  fade back to 1 in `showLists`. Cheap; perceived smoothness only — actual
  frame cost unchanged.

Neither shipped — current state is acceptable (97.66 % non-jank, 99.22 %
non-stutter). Flagged for follow-up if user revisits.

## Library → MangaDetails push — chain of fixes

User-reported sequence on this push: "library tabbed-mode tabs scatter and splatter
under the top bar that is being created as if it's trying to animate to the top,
then everything freezes then the manga page appears in one frame, then the first two
chapters jump then go down." Yokai (parent repo) doesn't have any of this. Each
distinct symptom maps to a different file. Diagnosed in parallel via four explorer
agents; one combined commit ships all fixes.

### 1. Tabs scatter — `LibraryController.teardownTabbedView` leaving branch

`teardownTabbedView(restoreAppBar = false)` was setting
`activityBinding?.mainTabs?.tabMode = MODE_FIXED` immediately on push-out, mid-frame
with the alpha-fade. `TabLayout` responds to a `tabMode` change by invalidating its
layout and re-measuring every tab — tabs visibly snap from variable scrollable widths
to equal fixed widths in one layout pass while the bar is still fully opaque. This
re-measure is what the user reads as "scatter/splatter".

**Fix:** `app/src/main/java/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/ui/library/LibraryController.kt` —
delete the `tabMode = MODE_FIXED` line in the leaving branch of `teardownTabbedView`.
`showTabBar`'s `doOnEnd` already calls `removeAllTabs()`; the next controller that
binds tabs sets its own mode. No regression. Keep `lockYPos = false` (harmless state
release that doesn't trigger re-measurement).

### 2. Freeze — three synchronous Compose first-compositions in `MangaHeaderHolder.bind()`

The transition is `CrossFadeChangeHandler` (200 ms alpha + 20 % translateX), NOT a
`MaterialContainerTransform`. So the freeze isn't shared-element setup — it's pure
Compose composition cost paid synchronously on the main thread before the animator's
first frame can render.

Hayai added three ComposeViews to the header layout that Yokai didn't have:

- `buttonGroupCompose` (`MangaContinueReadingButton`)
- `metadataCompose` (`MangaMetadataSection` — EH metadata, empty for non-EH)
- `mangaGenresTags` (`GenreTagsSection` / `NamespaceGenreTagsSection`)

Each pays Compose runtime startup + `YokaiTheme` (MaterialExpressiveTheme)
composition + slot table + measure synchronously during `bind()`, which is called
from RecyclerView's first layout pass — which is on the same frame the push
animation starts. With 3 first-compositions stacked, the animator's frame budget
is starved and the user sees a freeze.

`pagePreviewCompose` was already deferred via `postOnAnimation` (good for the
freeze, but caused a separate shift — see #4).

**Fix:** `app/src/main/java/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/ui/manga/MangaHeaderHolder.kt` —
wrap the three `setContent` calls in `postOnAnimation { ... }` so they compose on
the next animation frame, off the push critical path. Layout space is reserved by
`android:minHeight` on each ComposeView so when content lands there's no shift:

- `button_group_compose`: `minHeight="56dp"` (Material Button)
- `manga_genres_tags`: `minHeight="40dp"` (typical 1-row chip strip)
- `metadata_compose`: no minHeight needed (typically 0 for non-EH)

### 3. Freeze (palette fast-path) — `setItemColors` on Coil's `onSuccess`

`MangaDetailsController.setPaletteColor` has a cache-hit fast-path that fires
`setAccentColorValue` + `setHeaderColorValue` + `setItemColors()` synchronously
inside Coil's `onSuccess` callback. Coil delivers `onSuccess` on the main
dispatcher; `setItemColors()` iterates every visible `ChapterHolder` calling
`notifyStatus()` — all mid-frame. Yokai always defers via
`Palette.from(bitmap).generate { launchUI { ... } }`.

**Fix:** wrap the fast-path body in `launchUI { ... }` so the palette application
happens on the next UI tick instead of synchronously during the push frame.

### 4. Chapter rows jump after landing — `pagePreviewCompose` skeleton

`PagePreviewInlineSection` renders a 150 dp shimmer skeleton in its `Loading`
state. For sources that don't implement `PagePreviewSource`, the `LaunchedEffect`
hits `Unavailable` 1–3 frames later and collapses back to 0 dp. Result for
non-EH manga (most users, most of the time): chapter rows shift **down 150 dp
then back up** as the page-preview view loads then disappears.

**Fix:** in `MangaHeaderHolder.bind()`, do a synchronous
`presenter.source.getMainSource<PagePreviewSource>()` check before
`setContent`. If the source doesn't implement `PagePreviewSource`, set
`isVisible = false` on the ComposeView and skip `setContent` entirely. Only
EH/NHentai/Lanraragi etc. inflate the Compose subtree.

### 5. Top-bar appbar Y snap — `scrollViewWith` push-enter

`scrollViewWith`'s `onChangeStart` enter branch (line 435 of
`ControllerExtensions.kt`) called `updateAppBarAfterY(recycler)` immediately,
snapping the activity-level appBar Y from the outgoing controller's position
(could be collapsed if the user had scrolled) to the incoming controller's fresh
scroll position (Y=0) before the crossfade even started. The user reads this as
"topbar snaps to the top without animating".

**Fix:** moved the `updateAppBarAfterY(recycler)` call from `onChangeStart` to
`onChangeEnd`. The appbar now stays at the outgoing controller's position during
the 200 ms fade and only repositions once the transition completes. There's still
a small visible snap at the end (the appbar can't be in two positions at once
without an animator, which would be a bigger refactor) but it's masked by the
controller having already faded into place.

### Side effect — Library view "text/icon splatter" closed

The user-reported Library view splatter (task #14, baseline 5.03 %) turned out to
be the same root causes as fixes 1 + 2 (tabs re-measure + Compose first-compositions
firing mid-transition). Once those landed, the splatter went away. Task closed
without a dedicated fix.

### Known residual (left for follow-up)

- The appbar snap-at-end (#5) is still slightly visible. A truly clean fix would
  animate the appbar Y change over 200 ms in sync with the Conductor crossfade.
  User opted to accept the residual ("if it doesn't cost performance just leave
  it as that") rather than ship the bigger animation refactor.
- `setupSearchTBMenu` full menu rebuild on every controller change (Agent D's
  Patch D) — left untouched. Coalescing the 3 separate `ValueAnimator`s
  (`tabAnimation`, `searchBarAnimation`, `toolbarColorAnim`) into a single
  `AnimatorSet` would also help, deferred.

## MangaDetails page — polish + color fit + perf

User asked to polish the manga details surface itself (separate from the push
into it, which is the section above): "spacing and the description there's a
gap between the rating, the previews in eh looks a bit bad and cramped … make
the color detection a bit better and more fitting. make the layout overall more
consistent and stable." Scope: surgical changes only, no header rewrite — the
push critical path was just stabilized and a header-Compose rewrite would touch
it. Skipped baselining (gfxinfo/perfetto) because the changes are surface-level
and the perf-sensitive paths (push, scroll) weren't reported regressed.

### 1. `Palette.getBestColor` — too eager to pick dominant

`LibraryMangaImageTarget.getBestColor()` picked `dominantSwatch.rgb` whenever
its saturation was ≥ 0.25 and luminance in (0.2, 0.8). On many covers the
dominant swatch is a faintly-tinted background plate (sky, paper, large flat
shading) that meets those bounds while the cover's actual accent lives in
`vibrantSwatch`. Result: washed-out accents on the manga page.

**Fix:** `app/src/main/java/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/data/coil/LibraryMangaImageTarget.kt`
— raised dominant saturation threshold 0.25 → 0.35 and added a population
guard requiring `dominantPop > vibPop * 2.5` before preferring dominant.
Otherwise vibrant wins. Final `?: dominantSwatch?.rgb` fallback preserves
behavior for flat covers where only dominant exists. Shared with
`MangaCoverMetadata.kt:88`, so library tints get the same improvement.

Cached colors in `vibrantCoverColorMap` / `coverColorMap` are untouched —
existing library covers keep their previous picks until refreshed; new covers
go through the new logic. Non-regression for users with established libraries.

### 2. Soften accent blend in `setAccentColorValue`

`MangaDetailsController.setAccentColorValue` blended the accent toward
`colorOnDownloadBadgeDayNight` (a contrast text color) with factor
`luminance * 0.5` light / `-(luminance - 1) * 0.33` dark. The blend ran even
when the accent was already legible, washing out covers that didn't need
correction.

**Fix:** `MangaDetailsController.kt:317-326` — factors softened to
`luminance * 0.35` / `-(luminance - 1) * 0.22`. The same luminance gates
(`> 0.4` light / `≤ 0.6` dark) still trigger correction so out-of-theme
accents still get pulled into range, just less aggressively.

### 3. `EHentaiDescription` rating row + spacing

The EH metadata block had a Row with the genre chip on the left and a
two-line Column on the right (stars over `"%.2f"`). The right column made
Row 1 taller than the chip and produced visible vertical slack against the
uploader row below it. Outer padding was asymmetric
(`start=16, end=4, top=8, bottom=4`) while the rest of the header uses
`marginEnd=16dp`, so the right edge "ran out" before the rest of the page did.
Internal `spacedBy(4.dp)` was tighter than the header's 8/12 rhythm.

**Fix:** `app/src/main/java/exh/ui/metadata/adapters/EHentaiDescription.kt`
— stars + numeric rating inline on one line; outer padding `horizontal=16,
vertical=8`; vertical `spacedBy(8.dp)`. Rating is hidden when `≤ 0` instead
of showing five empty stars. FlowRow stat-row vertical spacing `2 → 4dp` so
wrapping stats line up cleanly.

### 4. `manga_header_item.xml` rhythm

Header XML mixed 6/8/12/14/16dp margins between blocks. Normalized to the
8/12/16 scale:

- `button_layout marginTop`: 14 → 12
- `manga_summary_label marginTop`: 6 → 8

Net header height unchanged (one block tightened by 2dp, the next loosened
by 2dp). Closes the user-reported "gap between rating and description" by
making the metadata→description-label transition match the 8dp rhythm of
the rest of the header.

### 5. EH page-preview strip polish + stability

`PagePreviewInlineSection` had three issues:

- LazyRow had `Modifier.padding(start=16.dp)` instead of `contentPadding` —
  no end padding, so the last card kissed the right edge with no fade-out
  affordance.
- "View all" CTA was a centered `Text` in a full-width `Box` *below* the
  strip, adding ~32dp to the section height when previews resolved but not
  during Loading. The Loading→Success transition therefore jumped from
  154dp to 186dp.
- Page-index label below each thumb was the default surface-text colour
  on the surface background — low contrast and visually disconnected from
  the thumb.
- No `key` on `items()`, so reorder/recompose churned all cells.

**Fix:** `app/src/main/java/exh/ui/pagepreview/components/PagePreviewInlineSection.kt`
— rewrote the section:

- Single `LazyRow` for both Loading and Success states with shared
  `contentPadding = horizontal=16dp` and `clipToPadding = false`.
- `THUMB_HEIGHT/WIDTH` 150/105 → 152/108 (corners now `shapes.medium`).
- Page number rendered as white text over a bottom-aligned 28dp vertical
  gradient scrim on the thumb itself (`Color.Transparent → Color.Black @ 0.55`),
  so it's readable regardless of cover content.
- "View all" moved to a trailing tail card in the LazyRow, same dimensions
  as the previews — keeps `ContentScale.FillWidth` for the thumbs (was kept
  intentionally, `Crop` would trim character heads at the top of pages).
- `items(s.previews, key = { it.imageUrl })` for stable recomposition.

Stability win: section height is now `152dp` in both Loading and Success,
`0dp` in Unavailable (still gated by the source-check from §"Library →
MangaDetails push #4"). No 32dp jump between Loading and Success means
chapter rows below no longer shift when previews arrive.

### 6. `MangaHeaderHolder` micro-perf

Two cleanups in `app/src/main/java/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/ui/manga/MangaHeaderHolder.kt`:

- `applyBlur()` was called both in `init` (when the backdrop ImageView has
  no bitmap yet) and in `updateCover.onSuccess` (when the bitmap lands).
  The init call sets `alpha=0.2f` + `RenderEffect.createBlurEffect()` on an
  empty view — no visible effect, just wasted allocations on every header
  view holder construction. Dropped the init call; the XML's default
  `android:alpha="0.1"` is what shows until the cover loads, which is the
  same visual state as before.
- `mangaSummary.post { … }` ran a post-layout `lineCount` probe after every
  `bind()` to decide whether to auto-expand short descriptions. `bind()` is
  called on every `notifyDataSetChanged`, so this fired repeatedly even when
  the description hadn't changed. Cached `(description, genre, initialized)`
  hash in `lastBoundDescSignature`; the post-layout probe only re-runs when
  the signature changes. The synchronous `expand()/collapse()` based on
  `adapter.hasFilter()` moved out of the post — they only toggle visibility
  flags and don't need a layout pass.

### Known residuals (left for follow-up)

- **Unified header ComposeView** — the four ComposeViews
  (`buttonGroupCompose`, `metadataCompose`, `mangaGenresTags`,
  `pagePreviewCompose`) still pay 4× Compose runtime entry + `YokaiTheme`
  composition. Coalescing into a single `ComposeView` hosting one
  `YokaiTheme { Column { … } }` would cut slot-table allocations and give
  a cohesive Compose subtree. Deferred because the push critical path was
  just stabilized and the unified header touches the same surface.
- **`setGenreTags` re-`setContent` on color change** — `updateColors(true)`
  re-runs `setContent` on `mangaGenresTags` to flow the new accent into the
  chip container colour. Should pipe the accent through `mutableStateOf`
  state instead; coupled with the unified-ComposeView follow-up.
- **No re-baseline** — user picked B/C/D/E and skipped the gfxinfo/perfetto
  pass. Surface didn't have a captured baseline before this work, so the
  perf wins are estimated from the source rather than measured. Open if a
  regression report comes in.

## Sources bottom-sheet tab swap — chain of fixes

User report: swapping between the Extensions / Novel / Migration tabs inside
`ExtensionBottomSheet` stutters. Worst on Migration → Extensions/Novel.

### 1. Per-row item animator

Each tab's `RecyclerWithScrollerView` recycler had no `itemAnimator = null` and a
default cache size of 2. Same fix as Recents / Browse.

**Fix:** `app/src/main/java/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/ui/extension/RecyclerWithScrollerView.kt`
— `setItemViewCacheSize(8)` + `itemAnimator = null` in `setUp`.

### 2. "Renders empty then fills in" on Novel tab

`presenter.onCreate()` eagerly loaded extensions but **not** novel plugins. The
novel adapter was bound to its recycler at pager init but the data wasn't
fetched until the user actually tapped the Novel tab — so the first tap showed
an empty list, then `refreshNovelPlugins()` ran, then the list populated.

**Fix:** `app/src/main/java/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/ui/extension/ExtensionBottomPresenter.kt`
— call `refreshNovelPlugins()` at the end of `onCreate()` so novel data is
loaded in the background as soon as the sheet is created. By the time the user
taps the tab, cached data shows immediately.

### 3. Redundant per-tap work in `onTabSelected`

Every tab tap called:
- `controller.updateTitleAndMenu()` — which on Migration↔{Extensions, Novel}
  crosses menu groups (`migration_main` vs `extension_main`) and does
  synchronous `toolbar.menu.clear()` + `inflateMenu(...)` + SearchView wiring.
- `recycler.requestLayout()` on the destination — re-measures heavy items
  mid-swipe (redundant).
- `presenter.refreshNovelPlugins()` for tab position 1 — duplicate of the
  onCreate preload; fires a network call on every tap.

**Fix:** `app/src/main/java/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/ui/extension/ExtensionBottomSheet.kt`
— drop `requestLayout()`, drop the per-tap `refreshNovelPlugins` (still in
`onTabReselected` for explicit user refresh), and defer `updateTitleAndMenu()`
by `SWAP_DEFER_MS = 350L` past the typical ViewPager settle.

### 4. Migration adapter swap on tab leave

`onTabUnselected(2)` called `presenter.deselectSource()` which fires
`setMigrationSources()` that swaps the migration adapter (MangaAdapter →
SourceAdapter when the user had drilled into a source) — `RecyclerView.setAdapter`
triggers a full layout pass on the still-attached migration recycler. With a
plain `View.post`, the swap landed on the swipe-settle frame and was visible.

**Fix:** same file — change `binding.pager.post { ... }` to
`postDelayed({ ... }, SWAP_DEFER_MS)` so the adapter swap fires after the
swipe has visually settled.

### Residual

User reports a remaining slight stutter on Migration → Extensions/Novel —
accepted as-is. Open candidates for future work if revisited:

- `SourceHolder.bind` at `app/src/main/java/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/ui/migration/SourceHolder.kt:56-69`
  posts `itemView.post { source.icon() }` for every visible source row.
  `source.icon()` → `ExtensionManager.getAppIconForSource()` → `PackageManager.loadIcon()`
  is a synchronous Binder IPC. On the first entry to the Migration tab per
  process, N posted Binder calls fire on the same frame. The `iconMap` warm
  via `RecentsPresenter.onCreate.preloadInstalledIcons()` covers users who
  opened Recents first; users who navigate straight to Browse → sources sheet →
  Migration hit the cold path. Triggering `preloadInstalledIcons()` from
  `BrowseController` initialization too would close this gap.
- Pre-resolve source icons off-thread inside `BaseMigrationPresenter` and cache
  on `SourceItem` (matching how `ExtensionHolder` pre-resolves), so
  `SourceHolder.bind` reads a cached `Drawable?` instead of triggering an IPC.
- Migration's MangaAdapter path still pays a full layout pass on the adapter
  swap — even deferred 350ms it's visible if the user re-enters Migration
  quickly. Could skip the swap entirely and lazy-reset on re-entry.

## Root nav transitions (Library/Recents/Browse) — chain of fixes

Baseline (mixed 6-swap run across all three roots, post sources-sheet fixes):

- Jank: 7.26 %, p99 300ms, Missed vsync 41, Slow UI 59, ~35 frames >= 200ms
  with peaks at 740ms / 506ms / 438ms

Diagnosis driven by a perfetto trace with `android.os.Trace.beginSection`
markers around all suspect functions (`Hayai/...`). Markers persist in the
code for future re-runs — capture with:

```
adb shell perfetto -o /data/misc/perfetto-traces/trace.pftrace -t 15s \
  -a dev.ahmedmohamed.hayai.debug \
  sched gfx view input am wm res binder_driver
```

then analyse via the Python `perfetto` package. Scripts at `.perf/analyze_rootnav*.py`.

### Trace findings (dominant costs per long frame)

- `RV OnLayout` runs 300–435ms per long frame.
- Inside: 10–15 `RV onCreateViewHolder` + `inflate` calls, each 15–40ms.
- Layout IDs of the heavy inflations:
  - `extension_card_item` (0x7f0d017e) — extension bottom sheet rows
  - `extension_card_header` (0x7f0d017d) — extension list headers
  - `manga_grid_item` (0x7f0d02e1) — Library/Browse grid items
- `LibraryController.onChangeStarted.enter` is the only controller hook >= 30ms (~35ms each).
  Other controllers' onChangeStarted are sub-10ms.

### 1. Skip no-op `nav` alpha animation in `syncActivityViewWithController`

`MainActivity.kt` always fired a 150ms `nav` alpha ValueAnimator on every
controller change, even when target alpha matched current (the common case
for root↔root since all three root controllers keep the bottom nav visible
at `alpha=1f`). 150ms of pure wasted per-frame invalidates.

**Fix:** short-circuit when `nav.alpha == targetAlpha`.

### 2. Cache `setSearchTBLongClick`

`setFloatingToolbar` re-attached the same `OnLongClickListener` on every
controller change. Set once behind a `searchTBLongClickSet` flag.

### 3. Defer `setupSearchTBMenu` via `post`

The menu diff + add/update/remove + actionMenuView requestLayout was running
synchronously on the change frame, blocking the Conductor crossfade.
`binding.toolbar.post { setupSearchTBMenu(...) }` moves it past the current
frame so the rebuild lands during the fade rather than gating it.

### 4. Defer `BrowseController.onChangeStarted` presenter refreshes to `onChangeEnded`

`BrowseController` was calling four presenter refreshes synchronously on every
controller change (`refreshExtensions`, `refreshNovelPlugins`, `updateSources`,
`refreshMigrations` + `updateSheetMenu` + `updateTitleAndMenu`). Each fired
`updateDataSet` on the corresponding recycler, which triggered the multi-hundred
ms `RV OnLayout` with ~15 `onCreateViewHolder` + `inflate` per frame.

**Fix:** moved the entire refresh block from `onChangeStarted` to
`onChangeEnded`. Refreshes run on the post-fade idle frame instead of mid-swipe.

### Root nav final state

| Trace | Jank % | p90 | Missed vsync | Slow UI | Frames >= 200 ms |
|-------|-------:|----:|-------------:|--------:|-----------------:|
| Baseline | 7.26 % | 16 ms | 41 | 59 | ~35 |
| After 1–3 (anim/menu) | 5.32 % | 14 ms | 37 | 45 | ~38 |
| After 1–4 (+ Browse refresh defer) | 6.22 %* | 14 ms | **11** | **14** | **15** |

\* Total frames smaller this run (595 vs 1729), so the % comparison is noisy.
Underlying signals (missed vsync, slow UI, draw cmds) all dropped 60–70 %.

### Residual (left for follow-up)

Three killer frames remain per nav cycle (700–750ms each) — these are the
**first-time controller-creation cost** where the recyclers inflate their
entire visible set. Mostly unavoidable without:

- **Pre-warm `RecycledViewPool`** during app startup so the first attach of
  Library/Recents/Browse recyclers pulls from a hot pool instead of inflating.
- **Lazy-bind the extension bottom sheet's inner ViewPager**. Currently both
  current + adjacent pages are inflated even when the sheet is collapsed —
  `extension_card_item` rows materialise even when the user can't see them.
- **Defer Library's `applyDisplayMode`** out of `onChangeStarted.enter`. It's
  the only controller's enter hook over 30ms (~35ms each). Likely candidates:
  the `setupTabbedView` / `teardownTabbedView` path.

The Trace markers (`Hayai/...`) stay in the source — re-running the perfetto
workflow above will show the same regions if these get revisited.

## Remaining problem flows (untouched)

| Flow | Baseline jank | Likely culprits |
|------|--------------:|------------------|
| Library ↔ Recents (tabbed) "text splatter" | 5.03 % | Cross-controller race: `LibraryController.onChangeStarted` calls `showTabBar(false, animate=true)` while `RecentsController.onChangeStarted` calls `mainTabs.bindStringTabs(...)` then `showTabBar(true)`. Library category labels get **overwritten in-place** by Recents labels mid-fade; TabLayout re-measures during the alpha animation. Surgical fix to `MainActivity.showTabBar` + the two controllers' `onChangeStarted`. |
| Browse hub — first entry | n/a | Sources hub entry cost (extension repo/lang reads, bottom sheet pre-warm). Trace required. |
| Recents item open (history → reader/manga) | n/a | Confirm whether it shares the same push cost as Library → Manga (now mostly fixed). |

### Profiling workflow

- Per-flow gfxinfo: `adb shell dumpsys gfxinfo <pkg> reset` → action → `adb shell dumpsys gfxinfo <pkg>`.
- Perfetto trace: `adb shell setprop security.perf_harden 0` (one-shot per session) then
  `adb shell perfetto -o /data/misc/perfetto-traces/trace.pftrace -t 15s sched gfx view input am wm res hal binder_driver`.
  Pull via PowerShell to avoid MSYS path mangling.
- Analyse via Python `perfetto` package (`pip install perfetto`); scripts in `.perf/`
  (gitignored).
